## Train-Ticket-Management-System-by-C-
This is my first year (2020) Software Development Project (SDP 1) course project. I was new then and just learned a little bit of c languese
and with the help of that knowledge I programed this software named Train Ticket Management System. This Program contains 26,756 lines of code.
I worked extreamly hard for this software because all had to submitted in just 20 days.
